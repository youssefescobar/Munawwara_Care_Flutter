# Privacy Policy for Munawwara Care

**Effective Date:** May 17, 2026  
**Last updated:** May 20, 2026

Munawwara Care (“we”, “our”, or “us”) operates the Munawwara Care mobile application (the “App”) and related services for organized Hajj and Umrah travel groups. This Privacy Policy explains what personal information we collect, how we use it, who we share it with, and your choices.

By downloading, accessing, or using the App, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

**Data controller:** Munawwara Care.  
**Contact:** munawwaracare@gmail.com

## 1. Who this App is for

The App is intended for **adults** participating in organized Hajj or Umrah travel with an authorized travel operator and assigned group moderator. It is **not directed at children under 13**. Accounts for pilgrims are created by authorized moderators or administrators, not by self-registration in the App.

---

## 2. Information we collect

### A. Account and profile information

- Full name, phone number, and role (Pilgrim or Moderator)
- Email address (typically for moderators; pilgrims may not have an email on file)
- Gender, age, and optional travel/logistics details (such as nationality/ID, visa information, hotel, room, bus assignment, ethnicity, and optional medical notes) when provided by your travel operator during account setup
- Account login and device binding data (including a device identifier used to bind a pilgrim account to one phone)

### B. Location information

- **Precise location (GPS)**, including **background location** when permitted
- **Pilgrims:** Background location is used so authorized moderators can see your position for group safety, including during an SOS alert, when the App is in the background or not actively in use
- **Moderators:** Location may be used when you use map and navigation features (for example, navigation beacons shown to pilgrims)

### C. Safety and coordination data

- SOS alert status and location at the time of an alert
- Battery level (pilgrim devices), shared with moderators for operational awareness
- Group membership and online/presence indicators
- Meetpoint and area alerts (location-related notifications sent by moderators to the group)

### D. Communications

- **Voice calls (Internet / VoIP):** Microphone audio via our real-time communications provider; call-related metadata such as timestamps, duration, and connection status
- **Carrier calls:** If you use in-app options to call a phone number, your device’s phone/dialer may be used; we do not record the audio of cellular calls
- **Moderator messages:** Text messages, voice messages, text-to-speech (TTS) announcements, and meetpoint messages sent by moderators to the group or to individual pilgrims. Pilgrims **receive** these messages; the App is **not** designed for pilgrims to send group chat messages. We do **not** support sending or receiving photo or image messages in the App.
- **SOS alerts to moderators:** After the urgent notification sound, the App may play a short **pre-recorded** safety message in the moderator’s selected app language (not live text-to-speech of your personal data).
- **Push notifications:** Firebase Cloud Messaging device tokens and notification delivery data

### E. Technical and usage data

- App version, language preference, and authentication/session tokens (stored securely on your device where supported)
- Information needed to operate the service (for example, IP address and request logs on our servers)
- Locally cached data on your device so limited information may be shown when the network is unavailable

**We do not use Google Analytics or a dedicated crash-reporting SDK in the App.** We do not sell your personal information and we do not use your data for advertising.

---

## 3. How we use your information

We use personal information only to operate group safety and coordination features, including:

- Responding to **SOS alerts** and sharing your location with authorized moderators in your group
- Showing pilgrim locations to authorized moderators on a private group map
- Delivering moderator announcements, reminders, and meetpoint alerts (including spoken reminders where enabled)
- Enabling **voice** calls between pilgrims and moderators
- Authenticating users and assigning them to the correct travel group
- Sending push notifications for safety, calls, and operator messages
- Processing in-app support and account-deletion requests
- Maintaining service security and reliability

### Safety disclaimer

Munawwara Care **coordinates your travel group**. It is **not** medical advice, **not** a medical device, and **not** a substitute for local emergency services (for example **999** or **911**). **SOS alerts your group moderator**, not emergency dispatch. In a life-threatening emergency, contact local authorities and official Hajj/Umrah emergency services.

### Moderator content

Messages and announcements in the App are sent by **authorized moderators** (or administrators) on behalf of your travel operator. Report inappropriate content or account concerns via **Contact support** in the App or **munawwaracare@gmail.com**.

---

## 4. How we share your information

We **do not** sell, rent, or trade your personal information.

We share information only as follows:

- **Within your authorized group:** Pilgrim location, name, SOS status, and related safety information with moderators assigned to your group
- **Service providers** (processors acting on our behalf), including:
  - **Google Firebase** — push notifications (Firebase Cloud Messaging)
  - **Google Cloud Run** — application API hosting (deployment region: **europe-west3**, European Union)
  - **Google Cloud Storage** — stored voice message audio and generated TTS audio files
  - **Google Cloud Translation & Text-to-Speech** — translated reminders and spoken announcements (not used for pilgrim SOS voice clips sent to moderators, which use bundled audio in the App)
  - **Google Cloud Tasks** — scheduled reminder delivery
  - **MongoDB Atlas** — database hosting (region as configured for our deployment)
  - **Redis** — rate limiting and operational caching on our servers
  - **Agora** — voice (WebRTC) calls
  - **Gmail SMTP** — password-reset email, in-app support requests, and account-deletion requests delivered to our support inbox
  - **OpenStreetMap / Nominatim** — map tiles and place search (requests may include your general map area or search terms; see their policies)
- **Legal requirements:** When required by law or valid legal process

When you open **Google Maps** or your phone’s dialer from the App, those services are governed by their own policies.

---

## 5. Background location (Google Play)

In line with Google Play policies:

- The App may collect location **in the background** for pilgrim safety
- **Purpose:** So moderators can assist pilgrims during SOS or coordination when the App is not in the foreground
- **Consent:** Before the operating system requests background location, pilgrims are shown a clear in-app disclosure explaining why background location is needed

---

## 6. Data retention and deletion

We keep personal information only as long as needed to provide the service and meet legal obligations.

- When a **moderator or administrator deletes a pilgrim account**, we delete that user’s account record from our systems
- When a **travel group is deleted**, group-related content (such as messages, call history tied to the group, reminders, and notifications) is removed; **pilgrim account records may remain** in an unassigned state until deleted by an administrator or upon request
- When you **log out**, session tokens are cleared on the device; some profile or location fields may remain on our servers until account deletion

### How to contact us or delete your account

**In the App (recommended):** Open **Settings** (profile) → **Privacy & support**:

- **Contact support** — describe your issue; your account details are included automatically and sent to our team (no email app required on your phone).
- **Request account deletion** — submit a deletion request; we process it according to this policy.

**By email:** You may also write to **munawwaracare@gmail.com**. For deletion, include your full name, phone number, and travel group name (if known).

**Moderators:** You may use the same in-app **Request account deletion** or **Contact support** options. Your travel operator’s administrator may also remove moderator accounts directly.

We will respond within a reasonable time subject to verification and applicable law.

---

## 7. Security

We use measures such as HTTPS for API traffic, secured WebSocket connections, encrypted real-time voice media (WebRTC) where supported, and secure on-device storage for session credentials where the platform allows. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.

---

## 8. International transfers and hosting

Our primary application API is hosted on **Google Cloud Run** in **europe-west3** (European Union). **MongoDB Atlas**, **Firebase**, and other providers may process data in regions configured in their respective services. By using the App, you understand that your information may be processed in those locations.

---

## 9. Changes to this policy

We may update this Privacy Policy. We will post the updated version at the same URL and change the “Effective Date” / “Last updated” date above. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the updated policy.
