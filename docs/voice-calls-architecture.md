## 1. High-Level Blueprint

Voice calling is built on a **dual-layer model**:
1. **Signaling Layer (Socket.IO + REST Fallbacks + Firebase Cloud Messaging)**: Handles call offers, rings, accepts, declines, cancellations, and state synchronization. It uses REST fallbacks (HTTP APIs) extensively to recover when sockets are dead or in a "ghost" state (connected on client but evicted on server).
2. **Media Layer (Agora RTC Cloud)**: Handles the low-latency voice transmission. Once signaling joins the parties, both sides retrieve a temporary RTC token from the backend and connect to an Agora channel.

    Server-->>Caller: FCM Data payload (type: call_answered)
    Note over Caller: Joins Agora Media Channel
    Note over Callee: Joins Agora Media Channel (Connected!)
```

## 2. The Three Critical Resolved Bugs (And How Not to Break Them)

The entire calling subsystem was completely broken due to subtle deadlocks, background socket evictions, and stale database records. Below are the details of the three resolved bugs so you can avoid reintroducing them.

### Bug 1: Pilgrim Answers call but has No Caller ID / Screen (Double Deadlock)
* **The Root Cause**: A double-deadlock occurred when a Pilgrim accepted a call:
  1. **Dashboard Listeners Timing Gap**: The FCM notification transitioned the call state quickly: `ringing` $\rightarrow$ `connecting` $\rightarrow$ `connected`. The dashboards (`pilgrim_dashboard_screen.dart` and `moderator_dashboard_screen.dart`) only had a single listener looking for `ringing` $\rightarrow$ `connected` transitions, missing the intermediate `connecting` step entirely.
  2. **Navigation Self-Block Guard**: When native CallKit is clicked, `NativeCallCoordinator` sets `_navigatingToCall = true` to guard dashboard listeners from double-pushing screens. However, `openVoiceCallScreen()` was checking `isNavigatingToCall` and blocking itself because it saw the guard was active.
* **The Fix (DO NOT TOUCH)**:
  * We updated both dashboards to monitor all adjacent states (`ringing -> connecting` and `connecting -> connected`).
  * We introduced a `bypassNavigatingGuard` parameter inside `openVoiceCallScreen()` in [call_navigation.dart](file:///c:/Users/drago/Desktop/projects/Durrah%20care%20mob%20app/Flutter_Munawwara/lib/features/calling/call_navigation.dart) and passed `true` inside `NativeCallCoordinator._tryPushVoiceCall()` in [native_call_coordinator.dart](file:///c:/Users/drago/Desktop/projects/Durrah%20care%20mob%20app/Flutter_Munawwara/lib/features/calling/native_call_coordinator.dart). This allows the coordinator to bypass its own lock and successfully push the screen.

### Bug 2: Calling a Pilgrim a 3rd Time Fails to Connect (Stale Call Records)
* **The Root Cause**: If a call ended abruptly or socket connections dropped (battery saver, network changes), the MongoDB records remained stuck in `ringing` or `in-progress` states. When the client polled the server (`/call-history/check-active`) to verify if the caller was free, the backend would return `active: true` matching a stale, dead call session, permanently blocking any new calls from connecting.
* **The Fix (DO NOT TOUCH)**:
  * **Server-Side Auto-Expiry**: In [call_history_controller.js](file:///c:/Users/drago/Desktop/projects/Durrah%20care%20mob%20app/mc_backend_app/controllers/call_history_controller.js), the `check_call_active` API now automatically sweeps and expires any record stuck in `ringing` or `in-progress` that is older than 5 minutes:
    ```js
    const fiveMinutesAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 5 * 60 * 1000);
    await CallHistory.updateMany(
        { status: { $in: ['ringing', 'in-progress'] }, createdAt: { $lt: fiveMinutesAgo } },
        { status: 'ended' }
    );
    ```
  * **Strict Ring-Poll Filtering**: The client is now passed the specific database `callRecordId` inside [call_signaling.dart](file:///c:/Users/drago/Desktop/projects/Durrah%20care%20mob%20app/Flutter_Munawwara/lib/features/calling/call_signaling.dart) upon offering a call. The [call_provider.dart](file:///c:/Users/drago/Desktop/projects/Durrah%20care%20mob%20app/Flutter_Munawwara/lib/features/calling/providers/call_provider.dart) uses this exact `callRecordId` during periodic watchdog polling, preventing the client from matching and reacting to old, dead calling sessions.

### Bug 3: Pilgrim Calls Back Moderator -> Rings but Accepting Does Nothing
* **The Root Cause**: Pilgrim devices operate in deep-sleep / background power-saver modes. When a Pilgrim pressed "Call Back" (SOS callback) and the Moderator accepted it, the Moderator's socket signal `call-answer` failed to reach the backgrounded Pilgrim. The Pilgrim device stayed ringing and never received the trigger to join the Agora RTC channel.
* **The Fix (DO NOT TOUCH)**:
  * **FCM Backed answered Signal**: We introduced a backup FCM signaling channel. When a Moderator answers a call (either via Socket `call-answer` or REST `/answer`), the server sends a high-priority FCM notification of type `call_answered` via `call_decline_service.js`:
    ```js
    await notifyCallerCallAnswered(callerId, callHistoryRecordId);
    ```
  * **Client Listener**: Registered `call_answered` in the FCM foreground and background message handlers ([mobile_messaging_bootstrap.dart](file:///c:/Users/drago/Desktop/projects/Durrah%20care%20mob%20app/Flutter_Munawwara/lib/core/bootstrap/mobile_messaging_bootstrap.dart) and [callkit_service.dart](file:///c:/Users/drago/Desktop/projects/Durrah%20care%20mob%20app/Flutter_Munawwara/lib/core/services/callkit_service.dart)). This triggers the caller's client to connect to Agora immediately, completely bypassing unreliable socket connections.

### Detailed Breakdown of File Roles:
*   **[call_provider.dart](file:///c:/Users/drago/Desktop/projects/Durrah%20care%20mob%20app/Flutter_Munawwara/lib/features/calling/providers/call_provider.dart)** *(Core State)*:  
    Owns the Riverpod state machine (`idle` $\rightarrow$ `calling` $\rightarrow$ `connecting` $\rightarrow$ `connected` $\rightarrow$ `ended` $\rightarrow$ `idle`). Manages local Media streams (Agora join/leave), toggles mute/speaker, runs the periodic **ring watchdog poll** to detect background declines, and enforces the mandatory **10-second post-call cooldown**.
*   **[native_call_coordinator.dart](file:///c:/Users/drago/Desktop/projects/Durrah%20care%20mob%20app/Flutter_Munawwara/lib/features/calling/native_call_coordinator.dart)** *(CallKit Bridge)*:  
    Bridges the native CallKit system events (`actionCallAccept`, `actionCallDecline`, `actionCallTimeout`, `actionCallEnded`) to Riverpod call state transitions. Implements cold-start/background **call recovery** when the app is launched by clicking the CallKit "Accept" button.
*   **[call_navigation.dart](file:///c:/Users/drago/Desktop/projects/Durrah%20care%20mob%20app/Flutter_Munawwara/lib/features/calling/call_navigation.dart)** *(Routing)*:  
    Manages navigation. Holds `openVoiceCallScreen()`, pushing the in-call UI over any active route using the global `AppRouter.navigatorKey`.
*   **[call_signaling.dart](file:///c:/Users/drago/Desktop/projects/Durrah%20care%20mob%20app/Flutter_Munawwara/lib/features/calling/call_signaling.dart)** *(Network Triggers)*:  
    Encapsulates REST fallback API calls (`/offer`, `/answer`, `/decline`, `/cancel`) and manages standard socket emitters.
*   **[voice_call_screen.dart](file:///c:/Users/drago/Desktop/projects/Durrah%20care%20mob%20app/Flutter_Munawwara/lib/features/calling/screens/voice_call_screen.dart)** *(Caller ID Screen)*:  
    The primary full-screen UI. Displays the peer's name, avatar initials, call status, speaker/mute control panel, and the red end-call button.
*   **[callkit_service.dart](file:///c:/Users/drago/Desktop/projects/Durrah%20care%20mob%20app/Flutter_Munawwara/lib/core/services/callkit_service.dart)**:  
    Configures and spawns the native iOS/Android system calling screens. Parses raw FCM data to extract calling controls.
*   **[mobile_messaging_bootstrap.dart](file:///c:/Users/drago/Desktop/projects/Durrah%20care%20mob%20app/Flutter_Munawwara/lib/core/bootstrap/mobile_messaging_bootstrap.dart)**:  
    The global messaging hub. Handshakes incoming foreground FCM notifications, filtering out general messages while routing high-priority call controls (`call_declined`, `call_cancel`, `call_ended`, `call_answered`) directly to `NativeCallCoordinator`.
*   **[socket_manager.js](file:///c:/Users/drago/Desktop/projects/Durrah%20care%20mob%20app/mc_backend_app/sockets/socket_manager.js)**:  
    Establishes socket connection hooks. Integrates high-level signaling (`call-answer`, `call-offer`, `call-declined`, etc.) and broadcasts room-wide notifications.
*   **[call_history_controller.js](file:///c:/Users/drago/Desktop/projects/Durrah%20care%20mob%20app/mc_backend_app/controllers/call_history_controller.js)**:  
    Owns the REST routing logic for `/offer`, `/answer`, `/decline`, `/cancel`, and `/check-active`. Auto-updates the MongoDB `CallHistory` model documents.
*   **[call_decline_service.js](file:///c:/Users/drago/Desktop/projects/Durrah%20care%20mob%20app/mc_backend_app/services/call_decline_service.js)**:  
    Composes and delivers high-priority background FCM data messages to wake up devices when socket streams are offline.

## 4. Four Structural Safeguards (Avoid Regressions)

If you modify the calling workflow, you **MUST** respect the following four critical safeguards that are active in the code:

### Guard 1: The Coordinator Navigation Lock (`bypassNavigatingGuard`)
*   **The Trap**: When Callee clicks "Accept" on CallKit, the app must transition to the `VoiceCallScreen`. To prevent the UI dashboard listeners from creating multiple duplicate screens, the `NativeCallCoordinator` sets a global navigation lock `_navigatingToCall = true`.
*   **The Guard**: `openVoiceCallScreen()` normally blocks navigation if `isNavigatingToCall` is `true`. To resolve self-blocking, the coordinator **must** bypass this check by passing `bypassNavigatingGuard: true` when pushing:
    ```dart
    final pushed = openVoiceCallScreen(bypassNavigatingGuard: true);
    ```
*   *Do not modify or remove `bypassNavigatingGuard: true` inside `_tryPushVoiceCall()` under any circumstances.*

### Guard 2: Stale Call Records Expiration
*   **The Trap**: Sockets can drop unexpectedly (due to battery saving, cellular changes, or crashes) before emitting `call-end`. Stale `ringing` or `in-progress` rows lingering on the server would cause the subsequent checks to return `active: true`, permanently blocking the moderator from placing any future calls.
*   **The Guard**: In `check_call_active` (`call_history_controller.js`), before checking activity, the server automatically expires any open call record older than 5 minutes:
    ```js
    const fiveMinutesAgo = new Date(Date.now() - 5 * 60 * 1000);
    await CallHistory.updateMany(
        { status: { $in: ['ringing', 'in-progress'] }, createdAt: { $lt: fiveMinutesAgo } },
        { status: 'ended' }
    );
    ```

### Guard 3: Accurate Ring-Poll Filtering (`callRecordId`)
*   **The Trap**: If a caller places a call immediately after a prior call, the regular polling on `/check-active` could match the prior stale call database record, triggering an immediate false "declined" state.
*   **The Guard**: The `/offer` REST endpoint returns the precise MongoDB database `callRecordId`. The Flutter client stores this ID and passes it directly to `_startRingPoll(..., callRecordId: id)`, filtering the check-active API query strictly to the current active record.

### Guard 4: Back-Gesture / Swipe-Back Prevention
*   **The Trap**: Swiping back on iOS/Android or clicking the hardware back button popped the `VoiceCallScreen`, hiding the UI while leaving the active background Agora voice channel playing indefinitely in the background.
*   **The Guard**: The root `Scaffold` in `voice_call_screen.dart` is wrapped in a `PopScope`. `canPop` is strictly tied to call status:
    ```dart
    final canPop = call.status == CallStatus.ended || call.status == CallStatus.idle;
    ```
*   *This locks the screen until the call is officially ended, forcing the user to tap the red end-call button to hang up and exit.*

## 5. Golden Rules for Future Developers & Agents

If you are a developer or an AI agent tasked with working on the calling module, you must strictly adhere to these rules:

1. **Never Use Socket-Only Signaling for Outgoing Calls**:
   * Pilgrim devices will fail to receive socket calls when backgrounded. Always launch call offers via the REST endpoint `/call-history/offer`.
2. **Ensure FCM Controls Bypass Foreground Presentation**:
   * FCM payloads such as `call_declined`, `call_cancel`, `call_ended`, and `call_answered` are functional control signals. They must **never** be presented as visible push notifications in the notification drawer. They must immediately run background processes silently.
3. **Coalesce Signaling States**:
   * Dashboard listeners *must* monitor both `ringing -> connecting` and `connecting -> connected` transitions to account for rapid FCM/REST state changes.
4. **Always Enforce Cooldowns**:
   * Keep the post-call 10-second cooldown in `call_provider.dart` (`hasRecentCallCooldown`) to allow local audio hardware and socket pipelines to clean up.
5. **Always Keep the PopScope Guarded**:
   * Ensure that the `PopScope` in `voice_call_screen.dart` is never removed. If it is removed, swipe-back gestures will trap the user in an un-nullable background call state.
6. **Deploy Server-Side Changes Prior to Testing**:
   * If you modify any call logic on the backend, you must deploy it to your staging servers (e.g. running the `.\redeploy_cloudrun.ps1` deployment script on Google Cloud Run) to ensure active sockets, DB expirations, and FCM fallbacks are live.
7. **Always Run Analysis Prior to Commits**:
   * Run `flutter analyze` inside `Flutter_Munawwara/` and verify that no lint errors exist. Ensure the project remains clean.
